# A boy who likes me
I have met a boy who name is zhigou wu. he comes from henan province and he is a postgraduate as well. I know him four years ago by my best friend because he is my best friends' friend. And we are online friends for about 2 years. Two years ago, he is coming to meet me. I feel very shocked by knowing he likes/loves me. I know his hometown is far away from my hometown. I don't think so that we have chance to get together. Nowadays, he works for a big company as a IT worker. His work is very hard and boring because they are lack of exercise regularly. But he can get a lot of money. I see it's very good. He hope he has a good habit of work and life for keep physical and mental health. I hope he could get futher education for his work and he could improve self-confidence and self-esteem. He always think about other's opinion for him. I want to change his word by myself. To make him follow my paces and improve his ability as possible as well. So nowadays, I focused on myself because I realize I should improve myself firstly. I hope he could become a good husband in future.
