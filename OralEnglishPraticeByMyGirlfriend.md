# A boy who likes me
I met a boy whose name is Zhiguo Wu 5 years ago. He comes from Henan province and he is a postgraduate as well as me. He was introduced by my best friend Xin Zhang who gets acquainted with Zhiguo Wu and became best friends of each other in high school days. After that, Zhiguo Wu became my online friends. Then after about a year, he decided to visit me suddenly. I felt shocked after knowing that he fell in love with me when we met for the first time. I know his hometown is so far away from mine that I don't think we have chance to be together. Nowadays, he works for a big company as a software engineer. His work is very hard and boring and they lack of exercise regularly. But he can earn a lot of money. I see it's very good. I hope he could build a good habit of keeping balance of work and life and staying physical and mental health. I wish he could improve self-confidence and self-esteem for he always cares about others' opinion for him. I want to change his world in order that he can be focused to improve hiw own ability as soon as possible. So nowadays, I just focus on myself because I realize I should improve myself firstly. Finally, I hope he could become my good husband in the future.
