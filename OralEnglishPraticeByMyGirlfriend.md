# A boy who likes me
I have met a boy whose name is Zhiguo Wu 5 years ago. He comes from Henan province and he is a postgraduate as well. I know him four years ago by my best friend because he is my best friend's friend. And we become online friends first 2 years. And then, he is coming to meet me to visit me. I feel very shocked by knowing he likes/loves me. I know his hometown is far away from my hometown. I don't think so that we have chance to get together. Nowadays, he works for a big company as a IT worker. His work is very hard and boring because they are lack of exercise regularly. But he can get a lot of money. I see it's very good. I hope he has a good habit of work and life for keep physical and mental health. I wish he could improve self-confidence and self-esteem as well as he always care about other's opinion for him. I want to change his wold by myself and he can focus on himself to improve his ability as soon as possible. So nowadays, I just focus on myself because I realize I should improve myself firstly. I hope he could become a good husband in future.
