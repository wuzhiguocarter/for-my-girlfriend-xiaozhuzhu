I want to talk about one of my teachers who works for Central South university as a psychologist. His name is Lihua Wu, who are also dedicated to work for the hospital in his spare time to help people with mental disorder. The lessons he teaches focus on developmental and educational psychology. He works very hard and always shares skills of psychological therapy with us. He spends most of his time on helping his patients and encouraging us to take practice to solve problems and futher lean psychological knowledges. We can feel his passon for his career, because we  can be encouraged by him all the time and learn lots of knowledges beyond the textbook. He gained many prizes for his teaching and therapy career. Most of people around him admire his ability.
